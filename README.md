# hull-js

hull-js is a micro-framework for building applications using JavaScript.

It is work in progress.

Here are the simple principles of the project.

* Vanilla Javascript code
* No bulky framework
* Responsive apps
* Desktop or mobile layouts
* Reusable and encapsulated components

Getting started:  
Download the project files  
Create a new component file and extend with AppComponent  
Add the new component to the App page using appendChild()  
Add a reference to the new component to index.html as a script  
Run index.html, and sail!

Running index.html will show some demo components.
